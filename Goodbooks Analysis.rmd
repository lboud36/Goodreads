# My Favorite Pasttime - Books! {-}

  > Welcome to my first exploratory data analysis! I thought for my first time I would delve into a familiar place: *books*. I've always loved reading and learning new things about books through data has been exciting. It turns out that the website [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/), which I've used to rate books that I've read, collects data from other users as well! So, let's set out to dig deeper into a topic that I have some domain knowledge. 

  In R, there are many different packages you can leverage to accomplish your goals. The `tidyverse` is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structure which makes analysis all the more intuitive.

## Lindsay's Reviewed Books {-}

  Goodreads collects data on every book as well as every user. You can download your personal information from the website. The data comes in a `.csv.` (comma separated values) format, so we'll leverage the `read.csv` function to bring the data in our environment.

  I'm real curious to see the distribution of the books I rated. When I created this table below, I realized there were ratings of 0 and I knew I had never rated anything 0. Let's go ahead and scrub this data clean of any ratings of 0. We can do this with `filter` in `dplyr`, a package within the `tidyverse`. If you're familiar with SQL, this is similar to a where clause.
  
  The table below is pretty close to what I was expecting. I rarely rate books at 1 or 2 and I usually give a rating of 4. However, I was surprised at how many perfect 5 star ratings I gave.
  
```{r Freq_Table, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}


rating_dist <- lindsay_goodreads %>% 
  select(Title, My.Rating) %>% 
  filter(My.Rating >0) %>% 
  count(My.Rating) %>% 
  rename(`My Rating` = My.Rating, `Number Of Books` = n)

cat("
<style>
caption {
      color: black;
      font-style: italic;
      font-size: 1.2em;
text-decoration: underline;
    }
</style>
")

rating_dist %>%
  kable(format = "html",caption = "Frequency Table of Ratings") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options  = "striped", full_width = F)

# position = "float_right")
  
```


I've always wondered if I was more harsh in my ratings than the average reviewer. Let's compare my ratings with the average rating on the website of everyone else. Here, I also add a column to show how different mine are from the masses. It seems I'm a bit more critical than the average reviewer of the books that I've read.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

rating_avgs <- lindsay_goodreads %>% 
  select(Title, My.Rating, Average.Rating) %>% 
  mutate(difference = My.Rating - Average.Rating) %>% 
  arrange(My.Rating) %>% 
  filter(My.Rating > 0) %>% 
  summarize(`Mean of My Rating` = round(mean(My.Rating),2),
            `Mean of Goodreads Users' Rating` = round(mean(Average.Rating),2),
            `Difference` = round(sum(difference),2))
  

rating_avgs %>%
  kable(format = "html",caption = "Comparison of Ratings") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options  = "striped", full_width = F)
```

##Publishers and Naming Conventions{-}
 
  Sometimes messy or unorganized data can make you feel like you walked into a room that's on fire. Never fear, we can fix our data issues by renaming the publishers so that they conform to one naming convention. However, some of the publisher names are duplicates, just in different words. As you can see, `Scholastic` and `Houghton` are represented in the table multiple times under different names. 

<!-- $\color{blue}{\text{Scholastic}}$ and $\color{blue}{\text{Houghton}}$  -->

<center>
![ ](https://media.giphy.com/media/137TKgM3d2XQjK/giphy.gif)
</center>


 
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
top_publishers <- lindsay_goodreads %>%
  select(Publisher, Average.Rating) %>%
  group_by(Publisher) %>%
  summarise(`Average Publisher Rating` = round(mean(Average.Rating),2)) %>% 
  top_n(10) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Average Publisher Rating`))

top_publishers %>%
  kable(format = "html",caption = "Top 10 Publishers") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options  = "striped", full_width = F)


```

  Now we can correct the names of our publishers, so that we can accurately represent the data. First, let's had to pull the list of publishers and see which ones needed to be combined. The easiest way to combine publishers is using the function `case_when` to list out each name that needs to be combined. When the new table is generated, the results are completely different and hopefully, more accurate and representative of the data. The new table looks much better now and doesn't contain any duplicates. 
  
  

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

publisher_fix <- lindsay_goodreads %>%
  arrange(Publisher) %>% 
  mutate(Publisher2 = case_when(grepl('Scho',Publisher) ~ 'Scholastic',
                                grepl('Peng',Publisher) ~ 'Penguin',
                                grepl('Bantam',Publisher) ~ 'Bantam',
                                grepl('Dell',Publisher) ~ 'Dell',
                                grepl('Houghton', Publisher) ~ 'Houghton Mifflin',
                                grepl('Alfred', Publisher) ~ 'Alfred Knopf',
                                grepl('Anchor', Publisher) ~ 'Anchor Books',
                                grepl('Bantam', Publisher) ~ 'Bantam Books',
                                grepl('Ballantine', Publisher) ~ 'Ballantine Books',
                                grepl('Del Rey', Publisher) ~ 'Del Rey Books',
                                grepl('Delacorte', Publisher) ~ 'Delacourte Books',
                                grepl('Dell', Publisher) ~ 'Dell Publishing',
                                grepl('Doubleday', Publisher) ~ 'Doubleday Books',
                                grepl('Dutton', Publisher) ~ 'Dutton Books',
                                grepl('HarperCollins', Publisher) ~ 'HarperCollins',
                                grepl('Mulholland', Publisher) ~ 'Mulholland Books',
                                grepl('New English', Publisher) ~ 'New English Library',
                                grepl('Random', Publisher) ~ 'Random House',
                                grepl('Yearling', Publisher) ~ 'Yearling Books',
                                TRUE ~ as.character(Publisher)))

top_publishers_fixed <- publisher_fix %>%

##Bindings and Box plots {-}
  In the Goodreads data, we have a field that described the type of binding I wondered if the type of binding had anything to do with the number of pages. These are the following types of bindings we have in our data : ``r unique(lindsay_goodreads$Binding)``.
  
  Let's try to inspect a few summary statistics to gain some more insights. By taking the average of the number of pages in book for a certain binding type, I can see if certain bindings tend to have more or less pages. It looks like mass market paperback books have the most pages on average, which makes sense, as they are usually smaller. 
  
  As expected, we see that the smaller sized pages Kindle versions have lead to the necessity for more pages. Interestingly, there's a large difference between `Mass Market Paperback` and `Paperback`.
  
  Many books are released only in paperback. They generally are 5" wide x 8 " long x 1" in depth. Mass Market paperbacks are smaller and generally are 4" x 6.5" with varied depths. This explains the page difference!

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bindings <- lindsay_goodreads %>% 
  select(Binding, Number.of.Pages) %>% 
  group_by(Binding) %>% 
  summarise(`Average Pages` = round(mean(Number.of.Pages),0)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`Average Pages`))

bindings %>%
  kable(format = "html",caption = "Bindings by Pages") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options  = "striped", full_width = F)

```
   Summary statistics don't always tell you the whole story, so it's always a good idea to visualize the data. [Anscombe's Quartet](https://www.r-bloggers.com/using-and-abusing-data-visualization-anscombes-quartet-and-cheating-bonferroni/) shows just how different data can be even if the basic statistics are the same. Francis Anscombe built four data sets with different `x` and `y` values which have the same mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation coefficient. However, upon further inspection, each of the four data sets look very different when graphed. 

  That being said, let's create a box plot by using `geom_boxplot` in `ggplot2` to show each book by it's binding. This shows the range of pages as well as compare the median between each binding. A box plot is a good way to see how the data is spread out. It shows the data as it is broken into quartiles (each one being a percentage of the data) and it's outliers (colored in `red`). This way you can easily see where most of books are in each group. The bindings are broken out into separate plots which makes it easy to compare.  
  
  Each book can be described by what kind of binding the book is. Once again, these are the following types of bindings we have in our data : ``r unique(lindsay_goodreads$Binding)``. It turns out Audio Cassette and ebook only had a few books to their name, so we'll remove them from the visualization below.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,fig.align='center'}

`%not_in%` <- purrr::negate(`%in%`)

# unique(lindsay_goodreads$Binding)


lindsay_goodreads %>% 
  filter(Binding %not_in% c('Audio Cassette', 'ebook')) %>% 
  ggplot( aes(x=Binding, y=Number.of.Pages)) +
  geom_boxplot(colour = "#3366FF",outlier.color = 'red')  +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.05) +
  ylab('Number of Pages') +
  theme_minimal()


```

#All Users Goodreads Data{-}

```{r include=FALSE}
book_tags <- read_csv('book_tags.csv')
books <- read_csv('books.csv')
to_read <- read_csv('to_read.csv')
ratings <- read_csv('ratings.csv')
```

In addition to my personal data, I found data for all users on Goodreads and general information on books that are reviewed on the website. There is a lot of data to look through and so let's dig in! Below, I find the five top rated books as well as each authors average rating. It looks like Calvin and Hobbes readers sure do love everything that Bill Watterson writes, since we find both in the top 5! When scrolling through the top authors, I found a name that I was unfamiliar with - [Hafez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafez). Turns out he was an Iranian 14th century poet who wrote many famous love poems. He is even enshrined in Tehran, Iran! 

```{r echo=FALSE}
#Top 5 books by rating
books_sorted <- books %>% 
  arrange(desc(average_rating)) %>% 
  # take top 5 rows
  filter(!grepl("Anony", authors)) %>% 
  top_n(5, average_rating) %>%
  #select columns needed
  select(title, average_rating) %>% 
  rename(`Title` = title,`Average Rating` = average_rating)

books_sorted %>%
  kable(format = "html",caption = "Top 5 Books") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options  = "striped", full_width = F)

#Average rating by author
author_ratings <- books %>%
  group_by(authors) %>%
  summarize(avg_rating = round(mean(average_rating, na.rm=TRUE),2)) %>% 
  filter(!grepl("Anony|Gaiman", authors)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_rating)) %>% 
  top_n(5, avg_rating) %>% 
  rename(`Authors` = authors,`Average Rating` = avg_rating)

author_ratings %>%
  kable(format = "html",caption = "Top 5 Authors by Average Book Rating") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options  = "striped", full_width = F)
```

  After finding the top rated books and authors, I thought it would be interesting to use the image_url column and add the books picture to a plot. To do that, we can build the plot with `ggplot`. Let's see if there's a correlation between the quality of the ratings and how many ratings, or how popular, a certain book is. If we take the books that have more than 1 million reviews, we see a slight positive correlation between the two.

```{r echo=FALSE}
 books %>% 
  arrange(desc(average_rating)) %>% 
  # top_n(10, average_rating) %>%
  select(title, average_rating, small_image_url, ratings_count) %>% 
  filter(ratings_count > 1000000,average_rating >= 3.5, average_rating <= 4.5) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = average_rating, y = ratings_count)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_jitter(width = .1) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm,colour="red", size = 1) +
  labs(x = "Average Rating", y = "Number of Ratings") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  theme_minimal()
  # geom_image(aes(image=small_image_url), size=.2)
```

  I thought it might be interesting to see if people tended to leave more text reviews for books they rated higher or maybe vice versa. I first made one without any restrictions, however, it didn't make much sense. Most reviews landed between 3.5 and 4.5, so I just used that range for my plot. As you can see below, there really isn't much of a relationship though.  I fit a regression line to see if there was any trend, but the line's slope is relatively flat signifying no relationship. In conclusion, the rating of book doesn't affect whether or not someone will write a text review, but does affect if someone will lazily assign a quick number (guilty as charged for some books!). 

```{r echo=FALSE}
#Plot of ratings by text reviews
books %>% 
  filter(work_text_reviews_count <  50000, average_rating >= 3.5, average_rating <= 4.5) %>% 
  ggplot( aes(x=average_rating, y=work_text_reviews_count))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_jitter(width = .1) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm,colour="red", size = 1) +
    labs(x = "Average Rating", y = "Text Reviews") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  theme_minimal()
```

#From Cover to Cover{-}

  After digging through the `Goodreads` data and exploring all the `tidyverse` has to offer, I learned about coding to answer questions as well as using R Markdown. It was nice to have different data sets, one that even had personal data to learn more about one of my hobbies. I never knew you could learn so much about books with data! I learned how fascinating it can be to look at data and find ways to look at it that no one else could.
